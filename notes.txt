Compiling the code
------------------
run script compile.sh and creates exectuble : externals_all


Running the code
-----------------
An example script , runradcorr_c , shows how to run the code.
The code reads the file, extern.inp, which has the format:
    1st line) comment
    2nd line) input kinematics file listing beam energy (GeV), scattered electron energy (GeV) and scattered electron angle (degrees)
    3rd line) target file which has input parameters for code. 
    4th line) output file with diagnostics information. The output file, extern.out , has the table of kinematics and radiatied cross sections.
The script assumes that extern.inp is:
input files for EXTERNAL: runplan/target/output
file.inp
file.targ
tst.out





Input files 
----------
1) reads file extern.inp to get 
    1st line) comment
    2nd line) input kinematics file listing beam energy (GeV), scattered electron energy (GeV) and scattered electron angle (degrees)
    3rd line) target file which has input parameters for code. 
    4th line) output file with diagnostics information. The output file, extern.out , has the table of kinematics and radiatied cross sections.

2) Note on input kinematics file: 
    a) Code assumes that first six lines of file are comments. This reading is done in subroutine READIN_EXT
    
3) Notes on target file format
    a) Has a very specific format read (see subroutine READIN_EXT) so must be careful about format.
    b) First 3 line read into COMMENT array then skips a line
    c) 5th and 6th lines read in IA and IZ with format 15x,i5 then skips a line
    d) 8th and 9th lines read in AVGA and AVGM with format 15x,f14.8 then skips a line
    e) 11th line reads in TARGET with format 20x,A7 then skips a line
    f) 13th-16th line reads in ttarg,twall,tbeam,tspec with format 15x,f14.8
    g) 17th lines reads NSEG with format 15x,i5 then skips 2 lines
    h) 20th line reads IG  with format 15x,i5 then  skips a line
    i) 22nd line reads IDUT with format 15x,i5
    j) 23nd line reads INEL_MODEL with format 15x,i5
    k) 24th line reads PAULI_MODEL  with format 15x,i5
    l) 25th line reads NUC_METHOD  with format 15x,i5
    m) 26th line reads NUC_MODEL  with format 15x,i5

4) Notes on target file variables
   a) IA and IZ are the atomic number and charge of target.
   b) If AVGA and AVGM are zero then calculated in subroutine weiz. For A>4 uses
      the Weisacker mass formula. 
   c) TARGET is used for specific experiments hardwired in the code to set the target
       radiation lengths in subroutine RADIATORS. If set to "readin" ( or any name
      that is not hadrcoded in subroutine RADIATORS) , the radiation
       lengths are set from input ttarg,twall,tbeam,tspec
      Also the variable SMRDEP is set differently from default for certain experiments.
   d) NSEG sets number of segments for the SIMPSON rule integration. Nseg must be EVEN.
   e) IG selects the elastic proton form factor model in subroutine NFORM ( see NFORM for list)
      IG=15 use Bosted fit. Should be updated with more recent parametrizations.
   f) IDUT selects the elastic deuteron form factor model in subroutine NUC_FORM_FACTOR.
   g) INEL_MODEL selects inelastic cross section model in INELAST.
      INEL_MODEL=4 selects F1F209 . Best option. Many older models available. 
   h) PAULI_MODEL sets model in subroutine PAULI_SUPPRESSION.
      0= old stein model; 1=tsai model; 2 no suppression
      F1F2QE09 uses Pauli suppression model from Tsai RMP 46,816(74) eq.B54 
   i) NUC_METHOD 0=No cos(theta_k) integration;  1= cos(th_k) integration
   j) NUC_MODEL  not used if INEL_MODEL=4.

 Flow of the code
------------------
   a) call ARENHOVEL_INIT . Original code needed access to /home/bosted/arenhovel/ directory.
      copied /home/bosted/arenhovel to arenhovel. Modified subroutine to look at arenhovel directory .
   b) open unit=17 file=extern.out
      open unit=19 file=ratioy.top which is a topdrawer file
      open unit=29 file=ratiow2.top which is a topdrawer file
   c) do loop to call R1998. Do not understand why this is done?
   d) call READIN_EXT which reads the target file.
   e) call RADLENGTH(X0) which calculates radiation length of target . Used to
      calculate AX0  = 0.000154*izz/amuM*X0  which is common block RAD used in functions
      and subroutines CONTINUUM, QETAIL, QEPEAK, EPEAK , FUNC1, FUNC2 , FUNC3, FUNC4P, FUNCQE, RADIATORS
      BREMS, ATAILFL1, ATAILFL_QE
   f) read in parm_to_use.txt which are parameters for Ioana's d2 model.
   g) loops through call  PAULI_SUPPRESSION for fill psf1,psf2 . Does not seem that psf1,psf2 are used. Why is it done?
   h) starts loop of kinematic points. Special flag introduced by Peter. For general case read input file to
      get E0SET,EPSET,THSET with format (1x,3f10.3) and exits loop at end of file.
   Looping through kinematic points
   i) calls SECNUCLW calculates inelastic born cross section, SIGMA_BORN, which calls INELAST to get W1 and W2. INELAST calls
      F1F2IN09 if INEL_MODEL=4.
   j) calls QUASIY8 calculate QE born cross section, SIGMA_CORR, which for IA >1 always uses CALL  F1F2QE09 to get F1 and F2.
   k) if smrelasp==.true. calls QUASIY8 to get smeared elastic born cross section, sigma_elastic
   l) set JTARG=1 which is flag in RADIATORS to calculate equivalent radiator for internal radiation
   m)  SIGMA_INEL(1) = CONTINUUM(0.)
   n)  SIGMA_QELA(1) = QETAIL(0.)
   o)  if smrelasp==.true. SIGMA_ELPK(1) = QETAIL(0.) else 
       if NUC_METHOD.EQ.0 then SIGMA_ELPK(1) = EPEAK(0.)
       elseif NUC_METHOD.EQ.1 then SIGMA_ELPK(1) = 0.001*ATAILFL1(0.)
   p) set JTARG=2 calculate internal+external radiation cross section
   q) get inelastic crossection CALL SIMP(0.,TTARG,NSEG,CONTINUUM,SIGMA_INEL(2))  numerical integration using Simpson's rule using
       the function CONTINUUM 
   r) get QE cross section CALL SIMP(0.,TTARG,NSEG,   QETAIL,SIGMA_QELA(2))
   o)  if smrelasp==.true. CALL SIMP(0.,TTARG,NSEG,   QETAIL,SIGMA_ELPK(2)) else 
       if NUC_METHOD.EQ.0 then CALL SIMP(0.,TTARG,NSEG,EPEAK,SIGMA_ELPK(2))
       elseif NUC_METHOD.EQ.1 then CALL SIMP(0.,TTARG,NSEG,ATAILFL1,SIGMA_ELPK(2)) 
   s)  SIGMA_INEL(2) = SIGMA_INEL(2)/TTARG                          
       SIGMA_QELA(2) = SIGMA_QELA(2)/TTARG  
       SIGMA_ELPK(2) = SIGMA_ELPK(2)/TTARG 
   t)  write to extern.out
       beam energy, scattered electron energy, scattered electron angle, x, q2,SIGMA_BORN+SIGMA_CORR,  
       sigma_qela(2) + sigma_elpk(2) + sigma_inel(2),sigma_elpk(2),sigma_qela(2),sigma_inel(2),
       SIGMA_BORN,iesv,iqsv,iwsv,sigma_qela(1) + sigma_elpk(1) + sigma_inel(1),sigma_elastic

       iesv,iqsv,iwsv filled when doeg1b flag is true
       
 
Modifications
---------------
   a) subroutine READIN_EXT . Modify so that in read the first six lines of kinematic input file
      to check for comments. If comment contains EG1b, then set  doeg1b=.true. and continue.
      Otherwise close and reopen file, assuming that it is a list of numbers.
   b) Eliminate the write statements to terminal except for kinematics when looping thru file.
   c) Remove writing out to louk.out 


Future Updates
--------------
   a) break code up into separate files and write a makefile.
   b) modify READIN_EXT to a simpler read format.
   c) create flag so ARENHOVEL_INIT is not always called.
   d) create flag so parm_to_use.txt is only read in when needed.
