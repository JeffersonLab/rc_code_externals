Input file
----------
1) reads file extern.inp to get 
    1st line) comment
    2nd line) input kinematics file listing beam energy (GeV), scattered electron energy (GeV) and scattered electron angle (degrees)
    3rd line) target file which has input parameters for code. 
    4th line) output file with diagnostics information. The output file, extern.out , has the table of kinematics and radiatied cross sections.

2) Note on input kinematics file: 
    a) Code assumes that first six lines of file are comments. This reading is done in subroutine READIN_EXT
    
3) Notes on target file format
    a) Has a very specific format read (see subroutine READIN_EXT) so must be careful about format.
    b) First 3 line read into COMMENT array then skips a line
    c) 5th and 6th lines read in IA and IZ with format 15x,i5 then skips a line
    d) 8th and 9th lines read in AVGA and AVGM with format 15x,f14.8 then skips a line
    e) 11th line reads in TARGET with format 20x,A7 then skips a line
    f) 13th-16th line reads in ttarg,twall,tbeam,tspec with format 15x,f14.8
    g) 17th lines reads NSEG with format 15x,i5 then skips 2 lines
    h) 20th line reads IG  with format 15x,i5 then  skips a line
    i) 22nd line reads IDUT with format 15x,i5
    j) 23nd line reads INEL_MODEL with format 15x,i5
    k) 24th line reads PAULI_MODEL  with format 15x,i5
    l) 25th line reads NUC_METHOD  with format 15x,i5
    m) 26th line reads NUC_MODEL  with format 15x,i5

4) Notes on target file variables
   a) IA and IZ are the atomic number and charge of target.
   b) If AVGA and AVGM are zero then calculated in subroutine weiz. For A>4 uses
      the Weisacker mass formula. 
   c) TARGET is used for specific experiments hardwired in the code to set the target
       radiation lengths in subroutine RADIATORS. If set to NONE, the radiation
       lengths are set from input ttarg,twall,tbeam,tspec
      Also the variable SMRDEP is set differently from default for certain experiments.
   d) NSEG sets number of segments for the SIMPSON rule integration.

5) Flow of the code
   a) call ARENHOVEL_INIT . Original code needed access to /home/bosted/arenhovel/ directory.
      copied /home/bosted/arenhovel to arenhovel. Modified subroutine to look.
   b) open unit=17 file=extern.out
      open unit=18 file=louk.out
      open unit=19 file=ratioy.top which is a topdrawer file
      open unit=29 file=ratiow2.top which is a topdrawer file
   c) do loops to call R1998. Do not understand why this is done?
   d) call READIN_EXT which reads the target file.
   e) call RADLENGTH(X0) which calculates radiation length of target . Used to
      calculate AX0  = 0.000154*izz/amuM*X0  which is common block RAD used in functions
      and subroutines CONTINUUM, QETAIL, QEPEAK, EPEAK , FUNC1, FUNC2 , FUNC3, FUNC4P, FUNCQE, RADIATORS
      BREMS, ATAILFL1, ATAILFL_QE
   f) read in parm_to_use.txt which are parameters for Ioana's d2 model.
   g) loops through call  PAULI_SUPPRESSION for fill psf1,psf2 . Does not seem that psf1,psf2 are used. Why is it done?
   h) starts loop of kinematic points. Special flag introduced by Peter. For general case read input file to
      get E0SET,EPSET,THSET with format (1x,3f10.3) and exits loop at end of file.
   i) calls SECNUCLW calculates inelastic born cross section which calls INELAST to get W1 and W2. INELAST calls
      F1F2IN09 if INEL_MODEL=4.
   j) calls QUASIY8 which for IA >1 always uses CALL  F1F2QE09 to get F1 and F2.
   k) 


6) Updates
   a) break code up into separate files and write a makefile.
   b) modify READIN_EXT to a simpler read format.
   c) create flag so ARENHOVEL_INIT is not always called.
   d) create flag so parm_to_use.txt is only read in when needed.
